# The Secure Web: The Definitive Guide
# by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

> **secure** (_adjective_): able to be trusted, safe, or reliable.

The **Secure Web** is a _technology platform_.

What some specialists might be tempted to colloquially call a _“tech stack”_.

The **Secure Web** is a _technology platform_ that is oriented towards **trustworthiness** of the platform for the individual using it.

The **Secure Web** is similiar to, and a variant of, the (classic) **Web** _technology platform_.

The **Secure Web** is an _evolution_ of the (classic) **Web** _technology platform_, but with **trustworthiness** of the platform in mind.

Programmers, and other specialists, who are familiar with
_software development_, _applicaion development_, and _product development_
using **Web** technologies, will find the **Secure Web** familiar.

That means that these programmers, and other specialists can use many of the same
programming languages, programmer libraries, file data formats, etc,
that they make use of when targeting **Web** for the **Secure Web** also.

## Secure Web: Trustworthiness

For a platform to be **secure** is must be **trustworthy**.

For many if not most people, if there is no **privacy** then there is no **trustworthiness**.

Part of having a **trustworthy** system is for a user to be able to make his or her _actions_, and _presence_ **private** to some degreee when he or she chooses to.

(Which can also include a user deciding not to be **private** at all, if that is what the user so chooses.)

## Secure Web: Decentralized, Distributed

The (classic) **Web** did have some ability for being **decentralized**, and being **distributed**.

However, there were important ways for which the (classic) **Web** could _not_ be **decentralized**, or **distributed**.

The **Secure Web** has tried to fix many of these deficiencies to evolved into more of a **Decentralized Web**, or **Distributed Web**.

## Zero Configuration Networking

> “When devices on a network can automatically communicate, advertise, and discover services for themselves, things become possible that simply wouldn't happen if humans had to configure everything manually.” -- Daniel H. Steinberg, Stuart Cheshire

**Zero Configuration Networking** is a set of technologies, based on top of the **Internet Protocol** (**IP**) suite, that can automatically communicate, advertise, and discover services for themselves.

**Zero Configuration Networking** is also often just called “**zeroconf**”.

> “The three technologies that make Zeroconf work are link-local addressing, Multicast DNS, and DNS Service Discovery.” -- Daniel H. Steinberg, Stuart Cheshire

> “Understanding how link-local addressing and Multicast DNS work is valuable background information, but when it comes to actual programming, most programmers will interact with Zeroconf through the DNS Service Discovery APIs in their chosen language.” -- Daniel H. Steinberg, Stuart Cheshire
