# The Secure Web: The Definitive Guide
# by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

The **Secure Web** is a _technology platform_.

What some specialists might be tempted to colloquially call a _“tech stack”_.

The **Secure Web** is a _technology platform_ that is oriented towards **trustworthiness** of the platform for the individual using it.

The **Secure Web** is similiar to, and a variant of, the (classic) **Web** _technology platform_.

The **Secure Web** is an _evolution_ of the (classic) **Web** _technology platform_, but with **trustworthiness** of the platform in mind.

Programmers, and other specialists, who are familiar with
_software development_, _applicaion development_, and _product development_
using **Web** technologies, will find the **Secure Web** familiar.

That means that these programmers, and other specialists can use many of the same
programming languages, programmer libraries, file data formats, etc,
that they make use of when targeting **Web** for the **Secure Web** also.

## Secure Web TL;DR

|                                                                  |

| **secure** (_adjective_): able to be trusted, safe, or reliable. |

For a platform to be **secure** is must be **trustworthy**.

For many if not most people, if there is no **privacy** then there is no **trustworthiness**.

Part of having a **trustworthy** system is for a user to be able to make his or her _actions_, and _presence_ **private** to some degreee when he or she chooses to.

(Which can also include a user deciding not to be **private** at all, if that is what the user so chooses.)
