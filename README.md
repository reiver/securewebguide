# The Secure Web: The Definitive Guide
# by [Charles Iliya Krempeaux](http://changelog.ca/)

The **Secure Web** is a _technology platform_.

What some specialists might be tempted to colloquially call a _“tech stack”_.

The **Secure Web** is a _technology platform_ that is oriented towards **trustworthiness** of the platform for the individual using it.

The **Secure Web** is similiar to, and a variant of, the (classic) **Web** _technology platform_.

The **Secure Web** is an _evolution_ of the (classic) **Web** _technology platform_, but with **trustworthiness** of the platform in mind.

Programmers, and other specialists, who are familiar with
_software development_, _applicaion development_, and _product development_
using **Web** technologies, will find the **Secure Web** familiar.

That means that these programmers, and other specialists can use many of the same
programming languages, programmer libraries, file data formats, etc,
that they make use of when targeting **Web** for the **Secure Web** also.
